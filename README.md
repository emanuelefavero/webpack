# webpack

This is a boilerplate for a simple **webpack** setup.

## How to use

-- cd into the project directory and follow instructions on README.md

## Tips

Webpack will use the `webpack.config.js` file by default. If you want to use a different config file, you can use the `--config` flag.

```bash
npx webpack --config webpack.config.dev.js
```

## Packages to install for a new project

- `npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`
